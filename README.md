# Web Analytics Accelerator  
GA4 → BigQuery → Looker Studio

## Overview
This project demonstrates how raw GA4 event data is transformed into
analysis-ready datasets using BigQuery and visualized using Looker Studio.

The focus is on data modeling, SQL transformations, and analytics
engineering practices rather than dashboard visuals alone.
